# Advent of Code 2023 in Python [![Python](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is my try on the Advent of code of 2023 challanges in Python. I've decided to use Python because I've always wanted to learn it since everyone seems to really like it and also because I need it for some classes in University.

## Structure

- `days`: the code for each day will be in the days folder as a `dayX.py` file.
- `inputs`: all my input data for each day is saved the inputs folder as a `inputX.txt` file. I also have a `test.txt` file, that I use for the example input of each days puzzle.
- `helpers`: contains my `helpers.py` and `template.py` files. The helper files has some functions to read the input data an I am pretty sure, I will add some other helping functions if I see that puzzles will need some generic functionality more than once. And the template file is my base for every days puzzle.

## Run Days

Simply run the wanted days file with python. (I used `python 3.11`)

This for example runs day1:
`python .\days\day1.py`

For any other wanted day just simply exchange the 1 with the day's number!
